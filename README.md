# HOLBERTON PROYECT - Raise the terrain
In this proyect we have to use the C library SDL2 to display an Isometric projection of a grid.

### Steps
> Step 1:

In this step I tried to learn how to use this library. After that I tried to do the grid in a simple version (2D version)

> Step 2:

Here, I tried to find a function to transform a 2 dimentional point to a 3 dimetional point and do the inverse.

> Step 3:

After that, I tried to transform the 2D vision grid in a 3D vision grid

> Step 5:

Then, I had to wor with the altures of mi 3D grid, which for some reason didn't work correctly

> Step 6:

Finally, I had to work with the rotation in 3D rotation with reference to the z axis, and also learn about the events (with the keaybord and mouse).

It was a Really hard work to me but I finally done, i learned a lot of things and reviewed some of my last clases.

# IT WAS A REALLY FUNNY PROYECT!!
